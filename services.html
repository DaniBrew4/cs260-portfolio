            <li><em>Pose-Verification: <a href='https://www.mutual.app/'
            target = '_blank'>Mutual</a></em><br>
              For my Statistics and Data Science Capstone my team and I created a Machine learning algorithm using Nueral Nets to help increase scammer detection when new accounts are created.
              In our algorithm we detect wether or not a new user is doing the pose asked in a live photo at the time of creation. We classified and cleaned the data, trained the models, and
              set up a working api for Mutual to and recieve their responses. We were able to cut the amount of time spent manually approving photos by<em>74%</em> with a 1.9%
              false negative rate.</li>
            <li><em>On campus Internship: Knitwork</em><br>

              match percentage rankings. Intership won 2nd place $10,000 Lassonde Entrepreneur Internship award.</li>
