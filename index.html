      <li><em>Pose-Verification: <a href='https://www.mutual.app/'
      target = '_blank'>Mutual</a></em><br>
        For my Statistics and Data Science Capstone my team and I created a Machine learning algorithm using Nueral Nets to help increase scammer detection when new accounts are created.
        In our algorithm we detect wether or not a new user is doing the pose asked in a live photo at the time of creation. We classified and cleaned the data, trained the models, and
        set up a working api for <strong>Mutual</strong> to and recieve their responses. We were able to cut the amount of time spent manually approving photos by<em>74%</em> with a 1.9%
        false negative rate.</li>
